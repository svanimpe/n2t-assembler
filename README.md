# HASM

An assembler for the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) Hack language.

**⚠️ Warning**: This is not how you're supposed to write this assembler. I just wanted to play around with regular expressions in Swift.

To run the assembler, make sure you have Swift 5.9 or later installed, then run the following command from the project directory:

```
swift run hasm <your-file.asm>
```
